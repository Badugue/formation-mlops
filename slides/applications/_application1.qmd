## Introduction to MLflow concepts

:::{.incremental}
1. In `VSCode`, open the notebook `mlflow-introduction.ipynb` (from the `notebooks` directory)
2. Choose our custom `Python` kernel : 
    + `Select Kernel -> Python environments... -> base (Python 3.x.x)`
3. Execute the notebook cell by cell. Try to understand carefully how the `Python` session interacts with `MLflow`. Explore the `MLflow` UI and try to build your own experiments from the example code provided in the notebook.
