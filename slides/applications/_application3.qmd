## Deploying a machine-learning model as an API

::::{.incremental}
1. We construct a very simplistic Rest API using FastAPI. All underlying files are in the `app` folder. Check it.
2. To deploy an API, you need to run it on a machine that contains all necessary packages, scripts, and configurations. The most convenient way is to build a Docker image containing all these specificities. Open the `Dockerfile` to see how the image is built. The image is publish via Github Actions, if interested have a look to `.github/workflows/build_image.yml`.
