## Deploying a machine-learning model as an API

1. We constructed a very simplistic Rest API using FastAPI. All underlying files are in the `app` folder. Check them.
2. Open the `Dockerfile` to see how the image is built. The image is automatically rebuilt and published via Github Actions, if interested have a look to `.github/workflows/build_image.yml`.
3. Open the file `kubernetes/deployment.yml` and modify the following lines accordingly:

```{yml code-line-numbers: "7"}
containers:
- name: api
    image: inseefrlab/formation-mlops-api:main
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    env:
    - name: MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI
        value: https://projet-formation-******.user.lab.sspcloud.fr
    - name: MLFLOW_MODEL_NAME
        value: fasttext
    - name: MLFLOW_MODEL_VERSION
        value: "1"
```

4. Open the file `kubernetes/ingress.yml` and modify (two times) the URL of the API endpoint to be of the form `<your_firstname>-<your_lastname>-api.lab.sspcloud.fr`
5. Apply the three `KLubernetes` contracts contained in the `kubernetes/` folder in a terminal to deploy the API
    + `kubectl apply -f kubernetes/`
6. Reach your API using the URL defined in your `ingress.yml` file
7. Display the documentation of your API by adding `/docs` to your URL
8. Try your API out!
9. Re-run a new model and deploy this new model in your API

1. Run a model
2. Register the model
3. Adjust your MLFLOW_MODEL_NAME or MLFLOW_MODEL_VERSION environment variable in the `deployment.yml` file
4. Commit and push these changes
5. Synchronise in Argo-cd or wait for 5 minutes
6. Refresh your API, it should be based on your new version!
