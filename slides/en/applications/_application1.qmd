1. In `VSCode`, open the notebook located at `formation-mlops/notebooks/mlflow-introduction.ipynb`
2. Execute the notebook cell by cell. 
3. If you are finished early, explore the `MLflow` UI and try to build your own experiments from the example code provided in the notebook. For example, try to add other hyperparameters in the grid search process.
