## Parallel training

- With our setup, we can train models one by one and log all relevant information to the MLflow tracking server
- What if we would like to train multiple models at once, for example to optimize hyperparameters ?

## Workflow automation

- Workflow automation tools : Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes
- Available on the SSP Cloud Datalab
- General principles :
    - Define workflows where each step in the workflow is a container
    - Model multi-step workflows as a sequence of tasks as a directed acyclic graph
    - This allows to easily run compute intensive jobs for machine learning or data processing
